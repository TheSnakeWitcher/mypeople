this are commonly called address books. I personally prefer contact
book because i find the last more intuitive.

mypeople add contact_name

# add fields to an existing contact
mypeople add contact_name -e "email_label:email_value" -s "social_media_label:social_media_value" 

# add a new contacts with fields
mypeople add new_contact_name -p "phone_label:phone_number" -w "wallet_label:wallet_address"
```
