# Purpose


**mypeople purpose is to help you manage your contacts**. Apps that do
this are commonly called address books. I personally prefer contact
book because i find the last more intuitive.


# Usage


```sh
# init db
mypeople init   
mypeople init path
```

```sh
# add contact
mypeople add contact_name

# add contacts fields to existing contact
mypeople add contact_name -e "email_label:email_value"

# add contacts with fields
mypeople add contact_name2 -p "phone_label:phone_number" -w "wallet_label:wallet_address"
```

```sh
# list all contacts
mypeople ls

# list subset of contacts 
mypeople ls contact_name contact_name2
```

```sh
# remove specific contact
mypeople rm contact_name

# remove specific field from contact 
mypeople rm contact_name -e email_label
```
